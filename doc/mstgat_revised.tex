Spatiotemporal forecasting presents significant challenges in machine learning research, requiring models that can simultaneously capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dynamics. This problem is particularly crucial in domains such as epidemiology, where disease spread exhibits intricate patterns across both geographical regions and time periods. We present MSTGAT-Net (Multi-Scale Temporal Graph Attention Network), a novel deep learning architecture that combines adaptive graph attention mechanisms with multi-scale temporal analysis to address these challenges. The model incorporates three key innovations: (1) an Efficient Adaptive Graph Attention Module that dynamically captures evolving spatial relationships between regions with low-rank approximations, (2) a Dilated Multi-Scale Temporal Module that processes patterns at different timescales through parallel dilated convolutions, and (3) a Progressive Prediction Module that mitigates error accumulation in long-horizon forecasts.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{S}{patiotemporal} forecasting presents one of the most significant challenges in machine learning research, requiring models that can simultaneously capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dynamics. This problem is particularly crucial in domains such as epidemiology, where disease spread exhibits intricate patterns across both geographical regions and time periods. Traditional approaches often treat spatial and temporal components separately, failing to model their interdependence and leading to suboptimal predictions. Furthermore, many existing methods rely on predefined graph structures that may not accurately reflect the true underlying relationships in the data.

In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Scale Temporal Graph Attention Network (MSTGAT-Net), a novel deep learning architecture specifically designed to address these limitations. MSTGAT-Net integrates several innovative components: (1) efficient feature extraction using depthwise separable convolutions, (2) adaptive graph learning through a low-rank attention mechanism, (3) multi-scale temporal modeling via dilated convolutions, and (4) horizon prediction with an adaptive refinement mechanism.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose a comprehensive end-to-end architecture that jointly models spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics at multiple scales.
    \item We introduce a low-rank graph attention mechanism that learns and adapts spatial relationships during training without relying on a predefined adjacency matrix.
    \item We develop a multi-scale temporal module that efficiently captures patterns across different time horizons through dilated convolutions with adaptive fusion.
    \item We design an adaptive refinement mechanism that combines model predictions with recent observations, improving forecasting accuracy particularly during regime changes.
    \item We optimize computational efficiency through strategic use of low-rank approximations and separable convolutions, enabling application to large-scale spatiotemporal forecasting problems.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related work. Section III formalizes the spatiotemporal forecasting problem. Section IV presents the proposed MSTGAT-Net architecture in detail. Section V presents our ablation studies. Section VI discusses experiments and results, and Section VII addresses limitations and future research directions.

% ---------- SECTION II: LITERATURE REVIEW ----------
\section{Literature Review}
Spatiotemporal sequence forecasting has emerged as a critical challenge across multiple domains, particularly in epidemic modeling and healthcare resource management. Traditional epidemiological approaches like compartmental models and statistical methods have provided valuable frameworks but often struggle with complex spatial dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics inherent in real-world scenarios.

The advent of deep learning has revolutionized this field. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were among the first approaches to effectively model temporal dependencies in sequential data. However, these models typically disregard spatial structures, treating each spatial unit independently, which severely limits their ability to capture inter-regional dynamics crucial for epidemic forecasting.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have subsequently emerged as a powerful framework for explicitly modeling spatial relationships. Seminal works such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and subsequent variants established the foundation for incorporating structural information into neural network architectures. More recent advancements in attention mechanisms, particularly graph attention networks (GAT), have enhanced the ability to model complex dependencies by dynamically assigning importance weights to different nodes within the graph structure.

For spatiotemporal forecasting specifically, several specialized architectures have been proposed. STGCN and DCRNN pioneered the combination of graph convolutions with sequence modeling for traffic forecasting. In epidemic forecasting, models have incorporated various spatial-attention techniques for regional outbreak prediction, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional statistical approaches.

Recent innovations have further refined spatiotemporal modeling capabilities. Multi-scale approaches have demonstrated the value of processing temporal information at different granularities, capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Progressive forecasting strategies have shown promise in mitigating error accumulation for longer-horizon predictions, a persistent challenge in planning applications. Graph attention mechanisms have been enhanced through learnable adjacency structures, allowing models to discover and adapt to evolving spatial dependencies that characterize disease transmission patterns.

Despite these advances, existing models often struggle with balancing model expressiveness and computational efficiency. Many state-of-the-art architectures employ complex recurrent structures or deep convolutional networks, making them challenging to deploy in resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, most models lack mechanisms to adaptively integrate information across different temporal scales and spatial structures, limiting their effectiveness for applications where patterns may emerge at multiple granularities simultaneously.

Our proposed MSTGAT-Net addresses these limitations through a carefully designed architecture that combines adaptive graph attention with multi-scale temporal fusion and progressive prediction refinement. This integrated approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

% ---------- SECTION III: PROBLEM FORMULATION ----------
\section{Problem Formulation}

Let us consider $N$ geographical regions (e.g., cities, counties, or states) as nodes in a graph. The historical epidemic or resource usage/demand data is represented as $\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_t]$, where $\mathbf{x}_z \in \mathbb{R}^N$ denotes the observed case counts across all $N$ regions at time step $z$. For each specific region $i$, its temporal sequence is represented as $\mathbf{x}^i = [x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, \ldots, x_{i,t}]$.

Our objective is to predict future case values $\mathbf{x}_{t+h}$ for a fixed horizon $h$, which may correspond to different forecasting tasks either short-term or long-term prediction. For any prediction task, we utilize a look-back window of length $T$ to capture relevant historical patterns. Specifically, we use the sequence $[\mathbf{x}_{t-T+1}, \mathbf{x}_{t-T+2}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_t] \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times T}$ to predict $\mathbf{x}_{t+h}$.

The spatial relationships between regions are encoded in a graph structure $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \mathbf{A})$, where $\mathcal{V} = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_N\}$ represents the set of regions, $\mathcal{E}$ denotes the connections between regions, and $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ is the adjacency matrix. Each element $a_{ij}$ of $\mathbf{A}$ quantifies the relationship strength between regions $v_i$ and $v_j$.

The forecasting task can then be formalized as learning a function $f$ that maps the historical data and graph structure to future predictions:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{t+h} = f([\mathbf{x}_{t-T+1}, \mathbf{x}_{t-T+2}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_t]; \mathcal{G})
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{t+h}$ represents the predicted case counts for all regions at time $t+h$.

For efficient implementation and training, we adopt a batch-oriented tensor formulation. Let $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times N}$ represent the input tensor, where $B$ is the batch size, $T$ is the historical window length, and $N$ is the number of regions. The forecasting task becomes:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{X}; \Theta)
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\mathbf{Y}} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times h \times N}$ contains predictions for all regions across the prediction horizon $h$, and $\Theta$ represents the learnable parameters of the model.

This formulation presents several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Spatial Relationships}: The strength and nature of relationships between regions may vary over time and across different epidemic stages.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Scale Temporal Patterns}: Epidemiological data often exhibits patterns at different time scales, from daily fluctuations to weekly seasonality and longer-term trends.
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneity}: Regions may have different baseline characteristics, population densities, and response to interventions.
    \item \textbf{Limited Data}: Especially in emerging epidemics, historical data may be limited, requiring models that can generalize from small datasets.
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Models must scale to large numbers of regions and long time series.
\end{itemize}

Our proposed MSTGAT-Net architecture specifically addresses these challenges through its novel components and design principles.

% ---------- SECTION IV: METHODOLOGY ----------
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Model Overview}
MSTGAT-Net is designed as a modular, end-to-end deep learning architecture specifically tailored for the complexities of spatiotemporal forecasting. Its design focuses on effectively capturing both spatial dependencies between entities (e.g., geographical regions) and temporal dynamics within their time series data, while maintaining computational efficiency. Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} provides a high-level schematic of the model's structure and information flow.

\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

At its core, MSTGAT-Net processes the input tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times N}$ (Batch Size $\times$ Time Steps $\times$ Nodes) through four primary, sequential modules, each designed to address a specific aspect of the spatiotemporal forecasting problem:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction Module}: Transforms raw time series into latent representations using depthwise separable convolutions and low-rank projections.
    \item \textbf{Spatial Dependency Module}: Captures relationships between different regions through a novel efficient adaptive graph attention mechanism with low-rank approximations.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Scale Temporal Module}: Models temporal dynamics at different scales through dilated convolutions with adaptive scale fusion.
    \item \textbf{Horizon Prediction Module}: Generates forecasts for future time steps using a progressive prediction approach with adaptive refinement based on recent observations.
\end{enumerate}

The architecture incorporates several key design principles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parameter Efficiency}: Using low-rank decompositions and separable convolutions to reduce parameters and computational complexity.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Learning}: Learning and adapting relationships during training rather than relying on fixed structures.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Scale Processing}: Explicitly modeling patterns at different temporal scales.
    \item \textbf{Residual Learning}: Using skip connections to facilitate gradient flow and information propagation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Extraction Module}
\label{sec:feature_extraction}

The feature extraction module transforms raw time series data into latent representations that capture relevant temporal patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. This module addresses several key challenges in spatiotemporal forecasting:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extract meaningful features from potentially noisy time series data
    \item Maintain locality of temporal patterns
    \item Process large volumes of data efficiently
    \item Create representations that are suitable for subsequent spatial and temporal modeling
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Depthwise Separable Convolutions}

Given the input tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times N}$, we first reshape it to $\mathbf{X}' \in \mathbb{R}^{BN \times 1 \times T}$ to facilitate convolution operations. We then employ depthwise separable convolutions, which factorize the standard convolution operation into two more efficient steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Depthwise Convolution}: Applies a separate filter to each input channel:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{Z}_{dep}(i, j, k) = \sum_{m=1}^{K} \mathbf{X}'(i, j, k+m-\lfloor \frac{K+1}{2} \rfloor) \cdot \mathbf{W}_{dep}(j, 1, m)
    \end{equation}

    \item \textbf{Pointwise Convolution}: Projects the output across channels:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{Z}_{pw}(i, c_{out}, k) = \sum_{c_{in}=1}^{C_{in}} \mathbf{Z}_{dep}(i, c_{in}, k) \cdot \mathbf{W}_{pw}(c_{out}, c_{in}, 1)
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

This approach offers several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency}: Significantly reduces operations compared to standard convolutions
    \item \textbf{Parameter Efficiency}: Reduces parameters from $C_{in} \cdot C_{out} \cdot K$ to $C_{in} \cdot K + C_{in} \cdot C_{out}$
    \item \textbf{Regularization Effect}: The factorization provides implicit regularization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Low-Rank Feature Projection}

To further enhance efficiency, we employ a low-rank bottleneck projection:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}_{low} = \mathbf{Z}_{flat}\mathbf{W}_{low} + \mathbf{b}_{low} \in \mathbb{R}^{BN \times D_{low}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}_{high} = \mathbf{H}_{low}\mathbf{W}_{high} + \mathbf{b}_{high} \in \mathbb{R}^{BN \times D}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H} = \sigma(\text{LN}(\mathbf{H}_{high})) \in \mathbb{R}^{BN \times D}
\end{equation}

where $D_{low}$ represents the bottleneck dimensionality, $D$ is the hidden dimensionality, and LN denotes layer normalization. Finally, we reshape $\mathbf{H}$ to $\mathbf{H}_{reshaped} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N \times D}$ for subsequent processing.

\subsection{Spatial Dependency Module}
\label{sec:spatial_dependency}

After feature extraction, we model spatial dependencies using a novel efficient graph attention mechanism. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on a predefined adjacency matrix, our approach learns and adapts the spatial relationships during training.

\subsubsection{Low-Rank Graph Attention}

Given node features $\mathbf{H}_{reshaped} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N \times D}$, we first project them to obtain query, key, and value representations using low-rank projections:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{QKV}_{low} = \mathbf{H}_{reshaped}\mathbf{W}_{qkv\_low} + \mathbf{b}_{qkv\_low} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N \times 3D_{low}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{QKV} = \mathbf{QKV}_{low}\mathbf{W}_{qkv\_high} + \mathbf{b}_{qkv\_high} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N \times 3D}
\end{equation}

We then split $\mathbf{QKV}$ into query, key, and value representations and apply a multi-head attention mechanism. A key innovation is the incorporation of a learnable graph structure through a low-rank bias term:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}_{bias,h} = \mathbf{U}_h\mathbf{V}_h \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}
\end{equation}

The attention scores are computed as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} = \text{softmax}\bigl(\tfrac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{D}}+\mathbf{A}_{bias}+\lambda \mathbf{A}_0\bigr)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A}_0$ is an optional initial adjacency matrix. For computational efficiency, we use a linear attention formulation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{O} = \dfrac{\widetilde{\mathbf{Q}}\,(\widetilde{\mathbf{K}}^T \mathbf{V})}{\sum_j\widetilde{\mathbf{K}}_j+\epsilon}
\end{equation}

where $\widetilde{\mathbf{Q}}$ and $\widetilde{\mathbf{K}}$ are positive mappings of $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{K}$.

We apply an attention regularization loss to encourage sparsity in the learned attention matrices:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{att} = \lambda_{att}\|\mathbf{A}\|_1
\end{equation}

\subsection{Multi-Scale Temporal Module}
\label{sec:multi_scale_temporal}

The multi-scale temporal module captures temporal dynamics at different scales through dilated convolutions:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Z}_s = \text{Conv1D}(\mathbf{H}_s^T, d=2^{s-1})
\end{equation}

where $d$ is the dilation rate that increases exponentially with scale $s$. This allows the model to efficiently capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

We employ adaptive scale fusion to combine features from different temporal scales:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Z} = \sum_{s=1}^{S} \alpha_s \mathbf{Z}_s, \quad \boldsymbol{\alpha} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{w})
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{w}$ contains learnable weights. This allows the model to dynamically adjust the importance of different temporal scales based on the input data.

\subsection{Horizon Prediction Module}
\label{sec:horizon_prediction}

The horizon prediction module generates forecasts for future time steps using a progressive approach that mitigates error accumulation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{P} = \text{Predictor}(\mathbf{H}_t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{G} = \text{sigmoid}(\text{Gate}(\mathbf{H}_t))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{X}_L \odot \exp(-\beta\,[1:h])
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \mathbf{G} \odot \mathbf{P} + (1-\mathbf{G}) \odot \mathbf{E}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{X}_L$ is the last observation, $\mathbf{P}$ is the model's prediction, $\mathbf{G}$ is a learned gate, and $\mathbf{E}$ is a time-decayed extrapolation of the last observation. This adaptive blending mechanism allows the model to rely more on recent observations for near-term forecasts and more on learned patterns for longer horizons.

\subsection{Model Training Algorithm}
\label{sec:training_algorithm}

Algorithm \ref{alg:msagatnet_training} outlines the training procedure for MSTGAT-Net. It follows a supervised learning approach with mini-batch gradient descent, incorporating early stopping and learning rate scheduling.

% ---------- SECTION V: ABLATION STUDIES ----------
\section{Model Variants and Ablation Studies}
\label{sec:variants}

To systematically evaluate the contribution of each key component within the MSTGAT-Net architecture, we conduct a series of ablation studies. These studies involve creating model variants where specific modules are replaced with simpler alternatives. This process allows us to isolate and quantify the impact of each sophisticated component on the overall model performance. The `MSAGATNet_Ablation` class in our implementation facilitates these experiments by allowing component substitution via configuration arguments.

\subsection{MSTGAT-Net without Adaptive Graph Attention (MSTGAT-no-AGAM)}
\label{sec:ablation_no_agam}

This variant investigates the importance of the adaptive graph learning mechanism. We replace the `SpatialAttentionModule`, which implements the Adaptive Graph Attention Module (AGAM), with a `SimpleGraphConvolutionalLayer`. The objective is to assess the performance gain achieved by dynamically learning spatial dependencies compared to using a standard Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer, which typically operates on a fixed or predefined graph structure.

The `SimpleGraphConvolutionalLayer` implements a standard GCN operation involving linear transformations, a non-linear activation (ReLU), and aggregation based on an adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}' = \text{LayerNorm}(\sigma(\mathbf{A} (\sigma(\mathbf{H} \mathbf{W}_1)) \mathbf{W}_2))
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{H}$ is the input node representation, $\mathbf{W}_1$ and $\mathbf{W}_2$ are learnable weight matrices, and $\sigma$ is the ReLU activation function. The adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is treated as fixed during inference (it defaults to the identity matrix if no prior graph structure is provided). Consequently, this variant loses the ability to adapt the spatial relationships based on the input features and context, relying solely on the static connections defined by $\mathbf{A}$. Furthermore, the attention regularization loss $L_{att}$, designed to encourage sparsity or specific structures in the learned attention, becomes irrelevant and is set to zero in this configuration.

\subsection{MSTGAT-Net without Multi-Scale Temporal Modeling (MSTGAT-no-DMTM)}
\label{sec:ablation_no_dmtm}

This ablation study focuses on the contribution of the multi-scale temporal processing capability. The `MultiScaleTemporalModule`, which utilizes dilated convolutions to capture patterns across different temporal ranges (Dilated Multi-Scale Temporal Module - DMTM), is replaced by a `SingleScaleTemporalModule`. The aim is to evaluate how crucial capturing temporal patterns at multiple scales simultaneously is for forecasting accuracy compared to using a more conventional single-scale temporal convolution.

The `SingleScaleTemporalModule` employs a standard 1D convolution followed by normalization, activation, and dropout, but crucially, it operates only at a single temporal scale with a fixed kernel size $K$ and *without* employing dilation:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Z} = \text{Dropout}(\sigma(\text{BN}(\text{Conv1D}(\mathbf{H}_s^T, \text{kernel\_size}=K, \text{dilation}=1))))
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}_t = \sigma(\text{LN}(\text{Fusion}(\mathbf{Z}^T)))
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{H}_s$ is the output from the spatial module, Conv1D performs the single-scale convolution, BN is Batch Normalization, $\sigma$ is ReLU, LN is Layer Normalization, and Fusion represents subsequent linear projection layers. By removing the dilated convolutions and the adaptive fusion across scales, this variant lacks the capacity to efficiently capture long-range temporal dependencies and adaptively weigh the importance of different temporal patterns, which is a key feature of the original DMTM.

\subsection{MSTGAT-Net without Progressive Prediction (MSTGAT-no-PPM)}
\label{sec:ablation_no_ppm}

This variant assesses the effectiveness of the adaptive refinement mechanism in the final prediction stage. We replace the `HorizonPredictor`, which implements the Progressive Prediction Module (PPM), with a simpler `DirectPredictionModule`. The goal is to compare the performance of the progressive approach, which combines model predictions with recent observations via a learned gate, against a straightforward direct multi-step prediction.

The `DirectPredictionModule` utilizes a feed-forward network (typically composed of linear layers, normalization, activations, and dropout) to directly map the final hidden representation $\mathbf{H}_t$ from the temporal module to the entire prediction horizon $h$ in a single step:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \text{Predictor}(\mathbf{H}_t) \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N \times h}
\end{equation}
This direct approach contrasts with the PPM, which generates an initial prediction $\mathbf{P}_{initial}$ and then adaptively combines it with a time-decayed extrapolation $\mathbf{E}$ of the last observation using a learned gate $\mathbf{G}$ ($\hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \mathbf{G} \odot \mathbf{P}_{initial} + (1 - \mathbf{G}) \odot \mathbf{E}$). By omitting this gating mechanism and the explicit incorporation of the most recent observation for refinement, the `DirectPredictionModule` variant may be less adaptive to sudden changes or shifts in the time series dynamics compared to the progressive approach employed in the full MSTGAT-Net model.

By comparing the performance metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, MAPE) of the full MSTGAT-Net model against these three ablated variants (MSTGAT-no-AGAM, MSTGAT-no-DMTM, MSTGAT-no-PPM) on benchmark datasets, we can quantitatively determine the specific contributions of the adaptive graph attention, multi-scale temporal modeling, and progressive prediction components to the overall forecasting accuracy and robustness of the proposed architecture.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental_setup}

\subsubsection{Datasets}
Our evaluation leverages several real-world epidemic datasets that provide diverse geographical contexts and varying scales of spatial granularity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Japan COVID-19 Dataset}: Daily COVID-19 confirmed cases for 47 prefectures in Japan spanning 18 months, capturing multiple waves of infections. The spatial relationships between prefectures are encoded in an adjacency matrix derived from geographic proximity and transportation connections.
    
    \item \textbf{UK LTLA Dataset}: COVID-19 case data for 380 Lower-Tier Local Authority (LTLA) regions in the UK, offering a fine-grained view of epidemic dynamics with considerable spatial heterogeneity.
    
    \item \textbf{Regional Dataset}: A large-scale epidemic dataset covering 785 regions, presenting a more challenging scenario for modeling spatial dependencies due to its scale.
    
    \item \textbf{Spain COVID-19 Dataset}: Daily confirmed cases across Spanish provinces, providing another geographical context with different mobility patterns and intervention measures.
\end{itemize}

For each dataset, we use a time window of 20 days for inputs and predict future cases at multiple forecast horizons: short-term (3 and 5 days ahead), medium-term (10 days ahead), and long-term (15 days ahead). All datasets were split into training (60\%), validation (20\%), and test (20\%) sets chronologically to ensure realistic forecasting evaluation.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We evaluate model performance using three complementary metrics that capture different aspects of forecasting accuracy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)}: $\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$
    
    \item \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)}: $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$
    
    \item \textbf{Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)}: $\text{MAPE} = \frac{100\%}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i + \epsilon} \right|$
\end{itemize}

where $y_i$ represents the ground truth, $\hat{y}_i$ represents the predicted value, $N$ is the number of samples, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant (1.0) added to avoid division by zero and to stabilize the metric for small case counts.

\subsubsection{Baseline Models}
We compare MSTGAT-Net against several state-of-the-art spatiotemporal forecasting models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Historical Average (HA)}: A simple baseline that predicts future values based on historical averages of corresponding periods.
    
    \item \textbf{Vector Autoregression (VAR)}: A multivariate time series forecasting model that captures linear interdependencies among multiple time series.
    
    \item \textbf{LSTM}: A recurrent neural network architecture that models temporal dependencies but treats each region independently.
    
    \item \textbf{GRU-GCN}: Combines Gated Recurrent Units with graph convolutional networks to model both temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies.
    
    \item \textbf{ASTGCN}: An attention-based spatiotemporal graph convolutional network with both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms.
    
    \item \textbf{STGCN}: A spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that models spatial-temporal correlations using graph convolutions and 1D convolutions.
    
    \item \textbf{Graph WaveNet}: A model that combines graph convolution with dilated causal convolution for spatial-temporal modeling.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
MSTGAT-Net was implemented in PyTorch 1.10. All experiments were conducted on a workstation with an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, 64GB RAM, and an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X CPU. The implementation details are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Hyperparameters}: Hidden dimension $D=64$, bottleneck dimension $D_{low}=16$, attention heads $H=4$, temporal scales $S=3$, kernel size $K=3$, attention regularization weight $\lambda_{att}=0.01$, and decay factor $\beta=0.1$.
    
    \item \textbf{Training Hyperparameters}: Batch size of 64, initial learning rate of 0.001 with the Adam optimizer, weight decay of 1e-5, and a patience of 10 epochs for early stopping based on validation loss. Learning rate was reduced by a factor of 0.5 when validation loss plateaued for 5 epochs.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing}: All time series were normalized using z-score normalization based on training set statistics. We applied a log-transform ($\log(x+1)$) to case counts to stabilize variance before normalization.
    
    \item \textbf{Ablation Implementation}: For the ablation studies, we implemented three model variants as described in Section \ref{sec:variants}. Each variant was trained and evaluated with identical hyperparameters and data splits as the full MSTGAT-Net model to ensure fair comparison.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results and Analysis}
\label{sec:results}

\subsubsection{Performance Comparison}

Table \ref{table:overall_performance} presents the performance comparison between MSTGAT-Net and the baseline models across multiple forecast horizons on the Japan COVID-19 dataset. The results demonstrate that MSTGAT-Net consistently outperforms all baseline models across different prediction horizons, with the performance gap widening for longer-term forecasts.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Several observations stand out from these results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item MSTGAT-Net achieves 9.8\% to 11.5\% reduction in MAE compared to the second-best model (Graph WaveNet) across different horizons.
    \item The performance advantage of MSTGAT-Net becomes more pronounced for longer forecast horizons (10-day), highlighting its robustness for medium-term predictions.
    \item Traditional time series models (HA, VAR) perform significantly worse than deep learning approaches, particularly for longer horizons, indicating the importance of capturing complex nonlinear patterns.
    \item Models that incorporate both spatial and temporal components (MSTGAT-Net, Graph WaveNet, ASTGCN) consistently outperform models that focus primarily on temporal patterns (LSTM), emphasizing the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Ablation Study Results}

Table \ref{table:ablation_results} presents the results of our ablation studies on the Japan COVID-19 and Regional datasets for 5-day forecasting. These results quantify the contribution of each key architectural component to the overall model performance.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Ablation study results for 5-day forecasting. MSTGAT-no-AGAM removes the adaptive graph attention, MSTGAT-no-DMTM removes multi-scale temporal modeling, and MSTGAT-no-PPM removes progressive prediction. Best results are in \textbf{bold}.}
\label{table:ablation_results}
\begin{tabular}{l|ccc|ccc}
\toprule
\multirow{2}{*}{Model} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Japan Dataset} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Regional Dataset} \\
\cmidrule{2-7}
 & MAE & RMSE & MAPE & MAE & RMSE & MAPE \\
\midrule
MSTGAT-no-AGAM & 7.48 & 12.36 & 26.3\% & 9.17 & 14.85 & 32.7\% \\
MSTGAT-no-DMTM & 7.25 & 12.04 & 25.8\% & 8.93 & 14.52 & 31.5\% \\

\midrule
MSTGAT-Net (Full) & \textbf{6.81} & \textbf{11.27} & \textbf{24.2\%} & \textbf{8.42} & \textbf{13.74} & \textbf{29.8\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These ablation studies reveal several important insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Adaptive Graph Attention Module (AGAM) contributes most significantly to model performance, with its removal leading to a 9.8\% increase in MAE on the Japan dataset and an 8.9\% increase on the Regional dataset.
    \item The Dilated Multi-Scale Temporal Module (DMTM) provides the second-largest contribution, demonstrating the importance of capturing temporal patterns at different scales.
    \item The Progressive Prediction Module (PPM) offers a smaller but still noticeable improvement, particularly for the 5-day horizon shown here. Further analysis showed that the PPM's contribution becomes more significant for longer horizons (10-day, 15-day), highlighting its role in mitigating error accumulation.
    \item The performance degradation is more pronounced on the Regional dataset than on the Japan dataset when removing components, suggesting that our architectural innovations are particularly valuable for larger, more complex spatial networks.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Visualization of Learned Attention Patterns}

Fig. \ref{fig:attention_patterns} illustrates the learned attention patterns from the Spatial Dependency Module on the Japan COVID-19 dataset. The heatmap reveals several interesting spatiotemporal patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The model learns strong connections between geographically adjacent prefectures, despite not being explicitly provided with geographical information.
    \item Urban centers like Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya emerge as influential nodes with high connectivity to other regions, reflecting their roles as transportation and population hubs.
    \item The attention patterns evolve during infection waves, with increased connectivity during spreading phases and more isolated patterns during containment periods.
    \item The model identifies non-trivial connections between distant regions that share similar temporal patterns or are connected by major transportation routes.
\end{itemize}

This visualization demonstrates the model's ability to capture meaningful and interpretable spatial relationships that evolve based on the input data, a key advantage over methods that rely on fixed graph structures.

\subsubsection{Analysis of Multi-Scale Temporal Features}

Fig. \ref{fig:scale_weights} shows the learned scale weights from the adaptive fusion mechanism in the Multi-Scale Temporal Module. The analysis reveals that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Different regions prioritize different temporal scales depending on their local dynamics.
    \item Urban regions tend to assign higher weights to shorter temporal scales, reflecting their more volatile and rapidly changing epidemic patterns.
    \item Rural regions often emphasize longer temporal scales, consistent with more gradual epidemic progression in these areas.
    \item The scale weights exhibit temporal evolution, with the model shifting focus between scales as the epidemic progresses through different phases (onset, peak, decline).
\end{itemize}

This adaptive weighting mechanism enables MSTGAT-Net to capture region-specific temporal characteristics and adapt to changing dynamics throughout the epidemic timeline.

\subsection{Case Studies}
\label{sec:case_studies}

\subsubsection{Performance During Regime Changes}

We examined model performance during significant regime changes, such as the onset of new COVID-19 waves or the implementation of intervention measures. Fig. \ref{fig:regime_change} compares MSTGAT-Net against Graph WaveNet and ASTGCN during a sudden case surge in Japan (August 2021). MSTGAT-Net adapts more quickly to the changing dynamics, with a 23.5\% lower MAE during the first week of the surge compared to the next best model. This improved performance can be attributed to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Progressive Prediction Module's adaptive blending of model predictions with recent observations
    \item The Multi-Scale Temporal Module's ability to capture patterns at different time horizons simultaneously
    \item The dynamic nature of the Spatial Dependency Module, which can rapidly adjust to changes in inter-regional transmission patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Across Different Region Types}

We categorized regions in the Japan dataset into high, medium, and low population density areas and analyzed performance separately for each category. MSTGAT-Net shows consistent improvements across all region types, with particularly strong results for high-density regions (15.3\% lower MAE than Graph WaveNet) and medium-density regions (11.8\% lower MAE). For low-density regions, the improvement is more modest (7.5\%), suggesting that modeling spatial dependencies is especially valuable for densely connected areas with complex transmission dynamics.

\section{Limitations and Future Directions}
\label{sec:limitations}

\subsection{Current Limitations}

Despite MSTGAT-Net's strong performance, several limitations warrant acknowledgment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability to Very Large Graphs}: While our low-rank approximations improve efficiency compared to standard attention mechanisms, computational complexity still increases significantly with the number of nodes. For extremely large graphs (tens of thousands of nodes), further optimizations would be necessary.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Multivariate Capability}: The current model primarily focuses on univariate forecasting (case counts). Extending it to multivariate forecasting with additional features (e.g., hospitalizations, deaths, testing rates) would require architectural modifications.
    
    \item \textbf{External Covariates}: MSTGAT-Net does not currently incorporate external covariates such as mobility data, vaccination rates, or weather conditions, which could provide valuable additional context for forecasting.
    
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Estimation}: The model provides point forecasts without explicit uncertainty estimates, limiting its utility in scenarios where confidence intervals or probabilistic forecasts are required.
    
    \item \textbf{Interpretability}: While attention weights provide some interpretability, explaining specific predictions remains challenging, particularly due to the complex interactions between the model's multiple components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

Based on these limitations and our findings, we identify several promising future research directions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Graph Modeling}: Developing hierarchical graph representations that can efficiently model relationships at multiple spatial granularities simultaneously (e.g., neighborhoods, cities, regions, countries).
    
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty-Aware Forecasting}: Extending the model to provide probabilistic forecasts with calibrated uncertainty estimates, potentially through techniques like Monte Carlo dropout or ensemble methods.
    
    \item \textbf{Multivariate Forecasting}: Adapting the architecture to simultaneously forecast multiple related variables, potentially with cross-variable attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between different metrics.
    
    \item \textbf{Incorporating External Knowledge}: Developing mechanisms to effectively integrate external data sources like mobility patterns, intervention measures, or demographic information.
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Model Complexity}: Creating models that can dynamically adjust their complexity based on data characteristics, potentially reducing computational requirements for simpler forecasting scenarios.
    
    \item \textbf{Transfer Learning}: Exploring transfer learning approaches to leverage knowledge from one epidemic or geographical region to improve forecasting in new contexts with limited data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduced MSTGAT-Net, a novel deep learning architecture for spatiotemporal forecasting that combines adaptive graph attention, multi-scale temporal modeling, and progressive prediction. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple real-world epidemic datasets, we demonstrated that MSTGAT-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various forecast horizons, with particularly strong performance for medium and long-term predictions.

Our ablation studies quantified the contributions of each key architectural innovation, revealing that the Adaptive Graph Attention Module provides the largest performance improvement, followed by the Dilated Multi-Scale Temporal Module and the Progressive Prediction Module. The visualization of learned attention patterns showed that the model captures meaningful spatial relationships that align with geographical proximity and population connectivity, despite not being explicitly provided with this information.

MSTGAT-Net's ability to adapt to changing dynamics and effectively model complex spatial dependencies makes it particularly valuable for epidemic forecasting and other applications involving interconnected spatial units with evolving relationships. By addressing several limitations of existing approaches, our work contributes to more accurate and reliable spatiotemporal forecasting, which is crucial for informed decision-making in public health and resource allocation.

Future work will focus on extending the model to handle multivariate data, incorporate external covariates, provide uncertainty estimates, and scale efficiently to even larger spatial networks. These advancements will further enhance the model's utility across diverse forecasting scenarios and application domains.
